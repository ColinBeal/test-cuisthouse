        The breadrumb components is used to help the user to know where he is in the application while he is navigating.
        We do not use it on the main page, but for every "/" in the route path you should add an item in the breadcrumb.
        The current state is defined by an active item.
        Items that are not active should have a routerLink so that the user can easily navigate to the parent elements.
